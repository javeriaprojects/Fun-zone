  <h2>😺 Detective Cat’s Case</h2>

  <p>In the foggy town of Whiskerburg, Detective Whiskers was no ordinary cat. She wore round glasses, a plaid scarf, and carried a mini magnifying glass tucked in her tail. Known for solving pastry thefts, missing toy mysteries, and secret garden riddles, she was the town’s top sleuth.</p>

  <p>One morning, Whiskers received a puzzling envelope with no stamp and no name. Inside was a single glitter sticker... shaped like a music note. She knew instantly that something was off in the Cozy Music Café at the edge of town.</p>

  <p>Tip-pawing past sleepy raccoons, she entered the café and noticed the jukebox was silent. The café’s owner, Mr. Hamster, was distressed—his magical music box, which played lullabies that put kittens to sleep, was missing. Without it, the kittens were bouncing off the walls in a sleepless frenzy.</p>

  <p>Using her keen nose and whisker sense, Whiskers followed a faint trail of glitter through the alley, behind the bakery, and into a hollow pumpkin garden. Inside a glowing squash she found the music box—playing faint tunes to a crowd of enchanted moths. Turns out the moths loved bedtime music and borrowed it without asking!</p>

  <p>Whiskers returned the box, tucked in a note that read “Borrow kindly,” and treated the moths to weekly concerts so everyone could enjoy. Her work won her a medal and a warm pie from Mr. Hamster. But to her, the real reward was seeing a café full of sleeping kittens once again.</p>
